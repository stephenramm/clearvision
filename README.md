# clearvision

Private project started some time ago and abandoned a short time later. I think it was actually python 2.7 at the time...

Some parts of this could be salvaged either as a front-end tool or just basis for importing openvx xml files?

There's a number of issues in the code as it is - for example you can easily connect outputs to inputs of a node. But it is interesting in a sort of way.
